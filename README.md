# CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECHTURE

### In this project, we dive into the implementation of client server architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

### In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as "Client" and the machine responding (serving) is called "Server".

### The project implementation involves tasks such as.
* Create and configure two Linux-based virtual servers (EC2 instances in AWS).
* MYSQL server installation
* Security Group: Inbound rule setting for access to the client server IP.
* Remote host configuration
* Database and Database user creation. etc.
